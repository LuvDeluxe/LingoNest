# .htaccess

# This file is crucial for making our router work correctly.
# It rewrites all incoming requests to be handled by our index.php file.
# This way, we can have clean URLs like /api/users instead of /index.php/api/users.

RewriteEngine On

# If the request is not for an existing file
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
# and not for an existing directory
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
# then rewrite the request to index.php.
RewriteRule ^ index.php [L]
